# ArduinoThermostat

This is a demo of UI design on an Arduino with a simple programmable thermostat. This lacks the back-end code to actually control an HVAC unit, but adding that code should be relatively simple.

This is the source code that accommodates a series of articles on The Hacking Den on [User Interface Design.](https://hackingden.com/category/user-interface-design/) Each branch will correspond to an article and can be used to see how we design and build our user interface.

# Controlling hardware.

This is a demo, but it does contain some logic for actually controlling an HVAC system. [We provide some notes on how you may wish to do this.](hardware.md)
