/*  MINCYCLE
 *
 *      Minimum cycle time in seconds. This is the minimum amount of time
 *  we will wait to turn on or off the heater or the cooler. This is to
 *  prevent unnecessarily short power cycles sent to the HVAC to keep from
 *  damaging the unit.
 *
 *      In the real world this would be set a lot longer. We set it to 1 min
 *  for testing purposes.
 *
 *      Note: if any of this shit blows up your HVAC, don't blame me.
 *  This is demo code.

/*  TEMPWINDOW
 *
 *      This is the +/- temperature window at which point we turn the
 *  HVAC unit on or off. If set to 1, this means when the heater is set to
 *  68, we actually turn on the heater at 67, and turn it off at 68. For
 *  the air conditioner set at 78, we actually turn it on at 79, and turn
 *  it off at 78.

/*  FANRUNWINDOW
 *
 *      This is the number of seconds past the time the heater or the
 *  air conditioner turned off before we wind down the fan. In practice the
 *  HVAC system's heating elements or cooling elements remain hot or cold
 *  after the system is turned off--and we want to continue blowing across
 *  them so they don't overheat, and so we get the residual heat or cooling
 *  into the room where it belongs.
