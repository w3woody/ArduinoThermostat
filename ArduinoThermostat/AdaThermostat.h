/*  MINCYCLE
 *

 *  we will wait to turn on or off the heater or the cooler. This is to
 *  prevent unnecessarily short power cycles sent to the HVAC to keep from
 *  damaging the unit.
 *
 *      In the real world this would be set a lot longer. We set it to 1 min
 *  for testing purposes.
 *
 *      Note: if any of this shit blows up your HVAC, don't blame me.
 *  This is demo code.

 *  the air conditioner set at 78, we actually turn it on at 79, and turn
