/*  ArduinoThermostat
 *   
 *      This is a demo of UI design on an Arduino with a simple programmable 
 *  thermostat. This lacks the back-end code to actually control an HVAC unit, 
 *  but adding that code should be relatively simple.
 *  
 *      This is the source code that accommodates a series of articles on 
 *  The Hacking Den on User Interface Design, at 
 *  https://hackingden.com/category/user-interface-design/

/*
 *  Much of our machinery has been moved elsewhere.
 *
 *  1.  The code for setting up the screen is contained in AdaUIScreen.cpp/h
 *  2.  The code for hit detection and managing the screens are in 
 *      AdaUIPage.cpp/h
 *  3.  The first screen we show, the home page, is contained in AdaHomePage.
 *      This also contains the declarations of the subsequent screens shown
 *
 *  That implies there is very little for this to do but call the initializer,
 *  start the page display mechanism, and poll for changes in time or temp.
